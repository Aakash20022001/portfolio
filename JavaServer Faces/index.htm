      <h1>JavaServer Faces</h1>

      <h2>Project Details</h2>
      <p>
        This is a demonstration of JavaServer Faces for server-side processing
        and database management.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Part 1</b> tracks how many times a user visits the webpage using
        session tracking, and displays their IP address and timezone.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Part 2</b> is a picture slideshow with navagation controls and captions.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Part 3</b> is an online custom computer order form with hardcoded
        product information and session-tracked customer data.
      </p>

      <h2>Analysis and Design</h2>
      <p>
        <b>Part 1</b> tracks the session using the cookieBean.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Part 2</b> contains a database of image names, urls, and captions.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Part 3</b> models popular online stores such as Amazon and Bestbuy.
        These sites have product pages with prices, specifications, colour/size 
        variations, and reviews. When added to the shopping cart, the websites
        display the order subtotal, tax, shipping, and total amounts before 
        checking out. My store has similar functionalities on a smaller scale.
      </p>

      <p>
        The site requires a Component class that contains all the product data
        organized by type, including model, price, and specifications. The
        computer is represented by a Component array during customization, and 
        then copied to another array when added to the cart, allowing further
        customization without accidentally affecting the cart.
      </p>
      <p>
        Functions include getter/setters for each component, and 
        subtotal/tax/shipping/total calculations. Ajax tags in each selection 
        menu update the form as options are modified.
