      <h1>Server Side Processing</h1>

      <h2>Project Details</h2>
      <p>
        <b>Part 1</b> demonstrates the use of MySQL and PHP to create on online bookmarking
        service in which multiple users can add to and modify their personal bookmarks.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Part 2</b> integrates online course materials written in XML using a custom
        schema definition and SQL tables with server-side parsing to HTML format.
      </p>

      <h2>Analysis and Design</h2>
      <p>
        <b>Part 1</b> references two SQL tables via PHP: 'users' and 'bookmarks'. The page
        begins with a login form which takes a username and password. The data is checked
        against the 'users' table and if valid, loads the user's bookmark collection
        from the 'bookmarks' table. A new account is created taking a desired username,
        password, and email. If the username or email is already in use, an alert will
        be made. Otherwise, the user data will be entered into the 'user' table. If the
        user forgets their password, the 'forget password' form asks for their email and
        sends them their login details.
      </p>
      <p>
        New bookmarks are added to the database by taking a site name, URL, and the
        current user. A user can add, modify, and delete entries associated with their
        account. Each bookmark pulls an icon from the target website on render.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Part 2</b> references two SQL tables via PHP: 'courses' and 'units'. The page
        begins with a course selection menu which name each course in the database.
        On loading a selected course, a title page appears which breifly describes
        the course and its units, with links to each one. On selecting a unit, its
        content is displayed with links to a multiple choice quiz and the next unit.
        The quizzes are parsed in PHP from an XML document to an HTML form and graded
        in JavaScript before displaying the correct answers and linking to the next unit.
      </p>

      <h2>Documentation</h2>
      <p>
        This assignment was tested in Internet Explorer, Opera, Firefox, and Chrome.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Part 1</b> has visual bugs in Internet Explorer but otherwise works well
        in all browsers.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Part 2</b> works in all browsers.
      </p>

      <h2>User Guide</h2>
      <p>
        In <b>Part 1</b>, create a new account, or login to the project account:<br/>
        <code style="display:block;margin:10px;">username: q <br/> password: q <br/></code>
        Then you can add a new bookmark by clicking '<i>New Bookmark...</i>' and entering
        a site name and url. The 'Edit Mode' button displays an editing form next to each
        bookmark. The button can be pressed again to hide the form.
      </p>
      <p>
        In <b>Part 2</b>, begin by selecting a course. Then navigate to a lesson, quiz,
        or course selection page via the header or in-page links. For quizzes, complete
        the multiple choice assessment and submit to see your grade and the correct
        answers to the quiz.
