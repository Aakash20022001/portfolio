      <h1>Web Technologies</h1>

      <h2>Project Details</h2>
      <p>
        This is a demonstration of HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, XML, and AJAX.
      </p><p>
        <b>Part 1</b> is a resume written in XML using a custom Schema Definition
        and XSL Transformations.
      </p><p>
        <b>Part 2</b> is an AJAX application which teaches web technologies
        through tutorials and quizzes.
      </p><p>
        <b>Part 3</b> is a slideshow application using HTML5 canvas.
      </p><p>
        <b>Part 4</b> is a utility application which perfoms various mathematical
        calculations.
      </p>

      <h2>Analysis and Design</h2>
      <p>
        <b>Part 1</b> consists of 3 data files (XML, XSD, XSL) and a general
        stylesheet (CSS). The XML contains my professional summary in hierarchical
        format with the <span style="font-family:monospace;font-size:16px;">
        PARENT:child</span> relationships below. The XSD file provides a formal
        definition of the above relationships, and the XSL file displays all the
        data in HTML format.
      </p>
      <ul style="margin-bottom:10px;"><li>
        RESUME:Name,Contact,Description,Skills,Qualities,Education,Experience</li><ul><li>
          CONTACT:Email,Phone,Mail</li><li>
          SKILLS:Skill</li><li>
          QUALITIES:Quality</li><li>
          EDUCATION:Program</li><ul><li>
            PROGRAM:Name,Year,School,Location,Detail</li></ul><li>
          EXPERIENCE:Job</li><ul><li>
            JOB:Title,Year,Company,Location,Detail</li></ul></ul>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <b>Part 2</b> consists of a single-page web application using AJAX to
        navigate through 6 web development lessons and graded quizzes. It uses an
        external XML document containing the different content sections of the
        application and internal JavaScript to manipulate the page and grade the
        quizzes.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Part 3</b> uses an HTML5 canvas to create a photo slideshow. JavaScript
        is used to switch photos with three possible transition styles: slide,
        dissolve, and fade. The slideshow also has 'start', 'stop', 'back', 'next',
        and 'random' transport functions, and photo captions.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Part 4</b> is a collection of three utility tools for measurement
        conversion, mortgage calculation, and room mode calculation. They take user
        input and then output formula-based results in realtime. The measurement
        utility converts between metric and imperial weights, lengths, areas, and
        volumes. The mortgage utility calculates monthly payment amounts and
        interest totals based on a compound interest formula using sale price, down
        payment, loan term, and annual interest rate variables. The room mode
        utility finds the resonant frequencies of highest interest in a rectangular
        space using a wavelength-to-frequency formula with length, width, and height
        variables measured in feet.

      <h2>Documentation</h2>
      <p>
        This assignment was tested in Internet Explorer, Opera, Firefox, and Chrome.
        All parts are fully functional in these browsers except for <b>Part 2</b>,
        which does not load in Internet Explorer due to the XMLHttpRequest not
        behaving as expected.
      </p>
      <p>
        In <b>Part 4</b> is a Room Mode calculator, which takes the
        dimensions of a rectangular room in feet, and outputs the axial resonant
        frequencies of the room below 300Hz. These frequencies have wavelengths that
        divisors of the room dimensions, and distort the sound inside. The equation
        if F=S/W, F is frequency in Hz, S is the speed of sound in feet per second,
        and W is the wavelength in feet. The speed of sound is 1130 feet per second
        in typical environments. This tool is useful in audio recording and playback
        contexts, as resonant frequencies will be artifically louder and quieter in
        certain areas of the room.
